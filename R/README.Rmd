# Parsing LabSolutions ASCII Output with R

This README shows a basic usage of `parse_hplc` function provided in the `R/parse-hplc.R` file in this repository. This function allows users to pass a file path to an output file to the function and it will retrieve the sample data from the .txt file. 

Here I will show a bried example of how it is done. 


First, I will `source` the required script. **NOTE:** This *may* move to a package later depending on want/need from people in the Lab for easier access/use

```{r}
source("parse-hplc.R")
```

This script will take care of installing any required packages that you do not already have installed on your system. It will also load the `parse_hplc` function into your global environment. Now we can simply call the function by giving it a path to an text file that was output from the LabSolutions HPLC. Here, the `ExampleInput.txt` will be used. 

If we do not specify an output path, than by default a tibble will be returned that can be used for further analysis. 

```{r}
parse_hplc("example-inputs/ExampleInput.txt")

# # A tibble: 131 x 7
#    sample_name     sample_id `Ca2+` `K+`    `Mg2+` `Na+`  `NH4+ -N`
#    <chr>           <chr>     <chr>  <chr>   <chr>  <chr>  <chr>    
#  1 singleinjection 1         0.000  0.000   0.000  0.000  0.000    
#  2 singleinjection 2         0.000  0.000   0.000  0.000  0.000    
#  3 singleinjection 3         0.000  0.000   0.000  0.000  0.000    
#  4 Cation Std Set  1         0.000  0.000   0.000  0.000  0.000    
#  5 Cation Std Set  2         0.000  0.626   0.000  0.103  0.156    
#  6 Cation Std Set  3         1.250  12.512  1.251  2.056  3.125    
#  7 Cation Std Set  4         2.500  24.999  2.503  4.124  6.233    
#  8 Cation Std Set  5         4.977  49.924  4.996  8.209  12.482   
#  9 Cation Std Set  6         10.005 99.902  10.019 15.972 24.933   
# 10 Cation Std Set  7         19.997 200.244 20.043 32.410 50.041   
# # ... with 121 more rows
```


By default, only the data is returned from this function with one row representing one sample with all of the analyses given as columns. If you are returning the info to your R session (i.e. leaving `path = NULL` as it is by default) than you can also get the rest of the information for each sample returned by setting `output_type = "full"`. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
parse_hplc("example-inputs/ExampleInput.txt", output_type = "full")

```

The raw output of this function can be a bit unwiedly, and it likely won't save well to any standard output type, other than maybe json, but you can explore it via R and RStudio's View pane. Here is a screen shot of the output of this function:

Finally, If you would like to simply save the file to a csv for use in excel, than you can just provide a path to the desired output.

```{r, include=FALSE}
parse_hplc("example-inputs/ExampleInput.txt", path = "example-outputs/example-output.csv")

```
